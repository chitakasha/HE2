Root directory for Bob and VM_B

The structure of required directories on the virtual machine VM_B and files in each of the directories are as follows:

- `/`: The root directory of VM_B, containing all files and subdirectories.
    - `/config.inf`: The config file that defines the bioinspired algorithm, quantum principle, and consciousness type for the code droplet.
    - `/inbox`: The directory that contains the input files for the code droplet, such as problem statements, parameters, datasets, etc.
        - `/inbox/problem.txt`: The text file that contains the problem statement for the code droplet.
        - `/inbox/parameters.txt`: The text file that contains the parameters for the code droplet, such as n, m, k, etc.
        - `/inbox/best_solution.txt`: The text file that contains the best solution found by the code droplet. This file is created by the code droplet and transferred to Bob's outbox directory via Git and GitHub.
    - `/outbox`: The directory that contains the output files from the code droplet, such as solutions, fitness values, log files, etc.
        - `/outbox/best_solution.txt`: The text file that contains the best solution found by Bob's code droplet. This file is transferred from Bob's inbox directory via Git and GitHub.
        - `/outbox/fitness_values.txt`: The text file that contains the fitness values of each solution in each iteration of the code droplet.
        - `/outbox/log.txt`: The text file that contains a log of all Git actions taken by the code droplet, such as commits, pushes, pulls, etc.
    - `/.git`: The hidden directory that contains all Git-related files and subdirectories, such as branches, hooks, objects, refs, etc. This directory is used to manage version control and synchronization with GitHub.
