git pull origin main #command to pull all changes from the main branch on github




To initialize the droplet on a virtual machine, you have a couple of options. Here are the steps for each:

### Option 1: Copy-Paste the Code into Terminal
1. SSH into your virtual machine.
2. Open a Python interactive shell by typing `python3` (or just `python` depending on your setup).
3. Copy-paste the entire Python code into the shell.

**Note**: This method is straightforward but not recommended for long-term or repeated use. It's also harder to debug if something goes wrong.

### Option 2: Make the File Executable and Run
1. SSH into your virtual machine.
2. Use a text editor to create a new Python file, e.g., `nano bing_droplet_1.py`.
3. Paste your Python code into this file and save it.
4. Make the file executable: `chmod +x bing_droplet_1.py`.
5. Run the file: `./bing_droplet_1.py`.

**Note**: This method is more professional and easier to manage. You can also easily add debugging and logging features.

### Additional Steps
- If your code uses external libraries, make sure to install them on your VM before running the code. You can use `pip install <library_name>` to install Python libraries.
- If your code relies on a specific Python version, ensure that version is installed on your VM.
- If your code uses Q#, make sure the Q# runtime is installed and properly configured on your VM.

Given the operations your code is performing (especially the git and system-level operations), you should run it with the necessary permissions. However, be cautious with running code that changes system-level configurations and permissions.
